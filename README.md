# So_long

The purpose of this project is to build a small 2D video game using MiniLibX and learn a bit about how a simple video game usually works.
# How to play ?

You need to compile all source files with make all.

To launch the game, execute ./so_long with a map as argument: ./so_long maps/map.ber

Pay attention: minimize is not working!
